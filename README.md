Various Playing Card Games

Currently the only card game actually playable here is blackjack, via the PlayBackJack class, but it features all the advanced rules you'd find at a casino such as doubling down, 
hand-splitting, and insurance betting.
Additionally, everything here has been design to keep the view separate from the model-controller, so if you wanted to make a blackjack game with graphics to one-up my text based
version of the game, you would not need to alter the BlackJackGame class at all or worry about having to do any awkward work arounds. 

I feel the content of this repo reflects my strong ability to design and implement multiple interlocking classes and pass data cleanly through multiple different inter-related objects.
