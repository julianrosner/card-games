Various Playing Card Games

So far I've only implemented blackjack, but it features all the more obscure rules you'd find at a casino such as doubling down, 
hand-splitting, and insurance betting.
Additionally, everything has been design to keep the view separate from the model-controller, so if someone wanted to make a blackjack game with graphics to one-up my text based
implementation, they would not need to alter the BlackJackGame class at all or worry about having to do any awkward work arounds.
